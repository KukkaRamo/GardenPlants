# GardenPlants
With this software, you may store information about what plants are in your garden and how many of them you have.  The plants are either basic plants, decoration plants, or utillity plants.
This software is based on a code sample I gave to one potential future employer.  The original software contained bank account data, but I modified the data elements to something that more people could utilize.  I have also extended the software a bit, trying more features of C++.  The company wanted a command line UI, but I have made a base UI class to make it easier to have other options for UI.  Also, I tried to make the type of the container where plants are stored independent on other patrs of the software, here it is a map.
